What is my goal?

How to achieve that?

During this course you will learn how to structure your home page in order to capture the visitor’s interest.

Your page’s job is to encourage visitors to read and scroll through the content and convince them to complete your ultimate conversion action (subscribe, buy, order, sign-up, ...). Very specific sections and copywriting elements will help you to reach this goal efficiently. The page template I give you is built to get the most conversions out of the total traffic you can generate on your page.
