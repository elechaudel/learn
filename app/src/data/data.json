      "description": "What is my goal? At the end of the year I want you to be more creative, organised and optimistic. Your fresh new marketing skills will give you a new point of view about the digital world. How to achieve that? For that purpose I've built an atypical course to help you discover and practice digital marketing skills. In my opinion there is no such way to learn than by playing. That's why the course is focused around a personal and transversal project. Your Project. The first module is dedicated to finding and defining your Project idea. You will learn how to setup the basics knowledge and information you must have on a project in order to promote it online the right way. In the second and third modules we'll learn how to spread the word effectively on search engines and social media. What am I expecting from you? I want you to take very seriously the first module as it will significantly drive the success of the course. I give you the opportunity to work on a Project that matters to you. Your Project will be your souce of inspiration and motivation throughout this course. At the end of this course you'll know exactly how to imagine, design and deploy a project idea on the web.",

      "description": "Have you ever heard about the Business Model Canvas? A Business Model Canvas forms the basements of every entrepreneurial projects. Whatever you want to build working with this concept will help you identify all the aspects that are essentials to the success of your project. During this course, we'll keep out the profitability aspect of the project so we can focus on what will make your project stands out with your audience. Finding who are the users of your Target Audience as well as what is the best Value Proposition will be the main missions of this chapter. By starting this course with the Business Model Canvas you're going to tackle a lot of marketing concepts that will help you determine how to promote efficiently your project on Search Engines and Social Networks whether you want to convince your Target Audience to buy, use or share your product/service/content. If you work for a client you'll need to have the same level of understanding of his project in order to make things right. In this situation, the Business Model Canvas and the Value Proposition Canvas will help you identify the key information you need to know or define before even working on any marketing medium.",
